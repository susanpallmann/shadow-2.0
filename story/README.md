# Story

GitHub markdown is probably not the ideal way to draft a story, but I like the formatting 
and the fact that updating it will show up in my GitHub commit history.

**All concept, writing, art, etc. is copyright.**

## Setting

The game takes place in a world much like Earth following nuclear fallout that impacted the
entire globe. The majority of mankind is wiped out, and what biology remains has been altered
via radiation to an extreme degree. Most wildlife has changed, and some lifeforms have even
converged, creating strange hybrid-like creatures. (This doesn't hold up scientifically, so 
the story should not take itself too seriously here.) In some unusual cases, new sentient
species emerged from the radiation, though it is unclear if these creatures originated as
animal or human. The few remaining settlements of "genetically pure" humans treat these other
humanoids with hostility and regard them as monsters. Human efforts are generally focused on 
survival, attempts to de-radiate the earth, and extermination of the "monster" settlements.

Time passed between the nuclear event and the start of the game still needs to be determined.
To inform this, though, I'm currently envisioning the world as rather overgrown, with little
evidence of civilization prior to the nuclear event.

## Player POV Timeline

### Exposition
The player wakes up in a human camp, surrounded by human NPCs in hazmat suits. The humans 
explain that they found the player outside the boundaries of their camp and were surprised
to find the player "unaffected". (OPTIONAL: One remarks that the player must have been quite
hurt as their face looked kind of like a monster's at first. "You must have healed quickly!")

The player is shown around the human encampment (which could also act as a tutorial). This
story process should introduce whatever common mechanics will be found in all settlements,
at minimum a trade/equipment opportunity. Most likely also some form of healing station?

*Currently undetermined is how the player's ability to adapt gets discovered.*

*Need to think through how the player is tasked with their mission. An early thought is to task
the player with bringing some kind of supply to another pure human encampment. This might also
be how we introduce monsters and the adaptation ability, honestly... Need to decide.*

When the player leaves the settlement, the player sees a large radiation warning, and is 
introduced to settlement entry for the first time, either seeing a guard at the gate, or
some kind of camera that examines the player. At this point it should be clear that humans
will only let in "genetically clean" humans. The player is also at this point introduced to
the game world, which should be in stark contrast to the sterile environment they just emerged
from. Plant life should be everywhere, the world should feel very much alive, and this 
appearance should be validated when the player begins to venture into the world and sees the
world qctively react to its movements.

As the player ventures out, I would really like to subtly hint at the fallout that took place,
maybe by having the remains of some modern-day objects hidden in the scenery. Subtle is key, 
though. I am more interested in having this feel like a new world than mourning the old one.

This might not belong here in the timeline, but it's worth mentioning: I almost want some
keystone-like shrines with abilities. While this is a sci-fi concept and not fantasy, I feel
like there is room to create a radioactive leftover tech piece that can act aesthetically and
functionally as a runestone or something. And in general, I want to look for opportunities to
make the modern and technological feel like a weird and ancient sort of magic. This doesn't 
even have to be crazy - a lot has changed and that technology may very well *be* ancient now.

Along the way to the next human settlement, the player will test out their adaption ability for
the first time to solve some minor roadblock. This can be something simple like getting frog
legs to jump over a boulder. We don't want to overwhelm the player yet, as the mechanic of 
absorbing abilites and letting them cool down is going to be a little complex as it is.

Writing down a random idea: maybe player holds down a key to absorb abilities?


## Surprises

*Spoiler alert. :P*

### Monsters are NPCs
The first key surprise to the game will be the player's discovery that "monsters" are actually
non-hostile NPCs under the right circumstances. By evolving to resemble sentient monster groups,
the player can actually interact and trade with monster settlements. In the same way, the player
will discover that initially friendly human camps are less hospitable when the player looks like
a "monster." The question asked here is, of course, **who are the real monsters?**

The player's answer to this question internally will affect which game ending the player gets to
experience. The player can either continue with the mission they were initially tasked with
(eliminating monster encampments, restoring earth to pre-nuclear state) or instead choose to make
peace with the monsters, embracing the notion that humanity is more about avoiding violence than
having a specific genetic makeup.

I believe the original idea was depending on the player's leaning on this question, they can
either continue trying to genetically cleanse the earth, or instead spread the radiation in the
belief that the destruction of "purity" as a concept might bring about peace.

There's a lot of room to support this question. After all, if the "pure" humans are the ones that
nuked the world into such a state, how human could they really be?

### The player might not be human
One idea I'm toying with but haven't decided on is throwing into question if the player was truly
human to begin with. An easy way to cast doubt into this is to have the player's introduction to
the human encampment they begin in start with someone saying something like "when we first saw you
your face looked kind of like a monster's... you healed really quickly though." This could be
explained by the game's core mechanic - the player's ability to adapt in realtime could have been
leveraged to make the player appear human to begin with, regardless of what the player's initial
state truly was.

### The nuclear event
I don't have a story for this presently. If I don't come up with one the game still works since 
it isn't at all difficult to imagine how mankind would have nuked the world, but I want to note 
that this can be an opportunity for a mystery the player might uncover if I so choose.

I do think either way that there should be scraps of books or something similar to sort of clue
the player in on what happened.

## Current inconsistencies

* I think my original idea was to have the player have come from space, which is why they're
drawn in an astronaut suit. However, this would suggest firmly that the player is human, which
we are trying to avoid. Perhaps the player is given the suit in an attempt to minimize the 
radiation experienced. In fact, if the encampments came from space it would actually make more
sense why they're genetically "clean." And then they would have a bunch of astronaut suits
laying around. Anyway, need to make a decision here.
