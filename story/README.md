# Story

GitHub markdown is probably not the ideal way to draft a story, but I like the formatting 
and the fact that updating it will show up in my GitHub commit history.

## Setting

The game takes place in a world much like Earth following nuclear fallout that impacted the
entire globe. The majority of mankind is wiped out, and what biology remains has been altered
via radiation to an extreme degree. Most wildlife has changed, and some lifeforms have even
converged, creating strange hybrid-like creatures. (This doesn't hold up scientifically, so 
the story should not take itself too seriously here.) In some unusual cases, new sentient
species emerged from the radiation, though it is unclear if these creatures originated as
animal or human. The few remaining settlements of "genetically pure" humans treat these other
humanoids with hostility and regard them as monsters. Human efforts are generally focused on 
survival, attempts to de-radiate the earth, and extermination of the "monster" settlements.

Time passed between the nuclear event and the start of the game still needs to be determined.
To inform this, though, I'm currently envisioning the world as rather overgrown, with few
remains of civilization prior to the nuclear event.
