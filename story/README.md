# Story

GitHub markdown is probably not the ideal way to draft a story, but I like the formatting 
and the fact that updating it will show up in my GitHub commit history.

**All concept, writing, art, etc. is copyright.**

## Setting

The game takes place in a world much like Earth following nuclear fallout that impacted the
entire globe. The majority of mankind is wiped out, and what biology remains has been altered
via radiation to an extreme degree. Most wildlife has changed, and some lifeforms have even
converged, creating strange hybrid-like creatures. (This doesn't hold up scientifically, so 
the story should not take itself too seriously here.) In some unusual cases, new sentient
species emerged from the radiation, though it is unclear if these creatures originated as
animal or human. The few remaining settlements of "genetically pure" humans treat these other
humanoids with hostility and regard them as monsters. Human efforts are generally focused on 
survival, attempts to de-radiate the earth, and extermination of the "monster" settlements.

Time passed between the nuclear event and the start of the game still needs to be determined.
To inform this, though, I'm currently envisioning the world as rather overgrown, with little
evidence of civilization prior to the nuclear event.

## Surprises

Spoiler alert. :P

### Monsters are NPCs
The first key surprise to the game will be the player's discovery that "monsters" are actually
non-hostile NPCs under the right circumstances. By evolving to resemble sentient monster groups,
the player can actually interact and trade with monster settlements. In the same way, the player
will discover that initially friendly human camps are less hospitable when the player looks like
a "monster." The question asked here is, of course, **who are the real monsters?**

The player's answer to this question internally will affect which game ending the player gets to
experience. The player can either continue with the mission they were initially tasked with
(eliminating monster encampments, restoring earth to pre-nuclear state) or instead choose to make
peace with the monsters, embracing the notion that humanity is more about avoiding violence than
having a specific genetic makeup.

There's a lot of room to support this question. After all, if the "pure" humans are the ones that
nuked the world into such a state, how human could they really be?

### The player might not be human
One idea I'm toying with but haven't decided on is throwing into question if the player was truly
human to begin with. An easy way to cast doubt into this is to have the player's introduction to
the human encampment they begin in start with someone saying something like "when we first saw you
your face looked kind of like a monster's... you healed really quickly though." This could be
explained by the game's core mechanic - the player's ability to adapt in realtime could have been
leveraged to make the player appear human to begin with, regardless of what the player's initial
state truly was.
